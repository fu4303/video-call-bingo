### Disclaimer
Thankfully, a lot of us are in the very privileged situation to be able to work from home during these trying times with Covid-19. So, complaining about log video-calls is something we Germans call __"Jammern auf hohem Niveau"__, what translate roughly to __"complain on a very high comfort level"__.
